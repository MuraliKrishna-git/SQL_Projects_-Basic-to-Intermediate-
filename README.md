Welcome to my collection of SQL projects ranging from beginner to intermediate level.  
This repository is aimed at practicing real-world SQL scenarios using **MySQL Workbench** and **MySQL Server**.

---

## 📌 Overview

These projects cover:
- Database and table creation
- Querying with SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING
- Aggregate functions and filtering conditions
- Writing and executing **Stored Procedures and Functions**
- Beginner-friendly structured code for practicing SQL logic and operations

You can run each `.sql` file independently to test concepts and learn syntax by doing.
